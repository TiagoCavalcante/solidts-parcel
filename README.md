)

## Quickstart

1. `npm install`
2. Customize the package.json file with the information about your project. Don't forget to change the license if you don't want MIT! Once a license is choosed it is hard to (legally) change it
3. Replace the code from src/ with your code
4. Add the files you want to delete after the build (if there are any) in rollup.config.js. Istead of deleting them you can just add to .gitignore
5. Run `npm publish` and wait people to use your library
